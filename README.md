# Simon Says

The task is to create a simon says game. The game should flash different colours squares in a repeating sequence. The squares should flash in an incrementing amount. See below.

> Sequence 1 - [RED]
> Sequence 2 - [RED,BLUE]
> Sequence 3 - [RED,BLUE,YELLOW]
> Sequence 4 - [RED,BLUE,YELLOW,GREEN]

After the squares have flashed on each sequence the user should be able to guess the sequence, if they guess the correct order the game will move on to the next sequence. If the incorrect order is given the user will lose a life. After losing 3 lives the game is over.
